# eBayDealFinder

The goal of this project is to find the best deals for used cars on eBay using machine learning.

For this project, I used a dataset found on Kaggle.com containing information scraped from 350,000+ German eBay pages. They were all in German and included relevant information for car shoppers such as the type of car and the mileage.

What I did with it:
- Explored and cleaned the data
- Created models to predict the price of a car based on other car features
- Scraped a fresh dataset from eBay Kleinanzeigen and made it match the initial's format
- Predicted the eBay selling price of the cars in my new dataset to identify underpriced cars
